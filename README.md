# Snake

My version of the Nokia phone game, for learning and fun.

This dates back from my very, very early days of programming so there are no tests!

Comments and suggestions are welcome. Pull requests not welcome; this is a fun project for me to tinker with.

## Requirements

Java
[Ant](http://ant.apache.org) (if you want to use the build tools)

## To play the game

`ant run` (also compiles)

Scores printed to the console.

## Other Ant commands

`ant compile` compile the classes
`ant clean` delete the classes

## Next steps (for me)

Look through for TODOs.

From @joehalliwell:

Might be an idea to:
- pause on start (for click/spacebar)
- print some instructions
- restart on spacebar or click?

If you're submitting this for review, might be worth
spending 30 mins:

- Adding javadoc comments, at least to some key methods -- I know this
is something I look for
- Adding javadoc to each class describing its role/responsibilities
- Adding README.txt pointing the reviewer at a good place to start
and/or any notable features
