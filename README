My version of the Nokia phone game. Purely for experimental purposes. This is version 1.0 - playable, but not perfect; comments and suggestions are welcome. 

ant compile --> compile the classes
ant run --> compile (if not already compiled) the classes and play the game
ant clean --> delete the classes

Suggetions from Joe Halliwell:

Might be an idea to:
- pause on start (for click/spacebar)
- print some instructions
- restart on spacebar or click?

If you're submitting this for review, might be worth
spending 30 mins:

- Adding javadoc comments, at least to some key methods -- I know this
is something I look for
- Adding javadoc to each class describing its role/responsibilities
- Adding README.txt pointing the reviewer at a good place to start
and/or any notable features
