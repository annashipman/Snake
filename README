My version of the Nokia phone game. Purely for experimental purposes. This is version 1.0 - playable, but not perfect; comments and suggestions are welcome. 

ant compile --> compile the classes
ant run --> compile (if not already compiled) the classes and play the game
ant clean --> delete the classes
